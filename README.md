# **Rock Music Analysis**

## **Description**

This project explores the evolution of rock music between the years (1956- 1999) using Spotify data from [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lukaszamora/history-of-rock-19502020).

The dataset contains information about 5,000+ songs including their name, artist, release year, popularity score, and various audio features such as energy, danceability, etc.

This project focuses on patterns in **popularity, energy, danceability, and acousticness** of songs across decades.

The analysis was done using **Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** to uncover key trends and insights.

## **Analysis steps followed**

- Data Understanding (understanding the dataset and its contents)
- Data Preparation (data preparation includes cleaning and organizing the dataset before analysis)
- Exploratory Analysis and Visualization (we understand the data patterns, trends, and relationships and explore the dataset)
- Asking and Answering Questions (answering questions about the data using a plot or statistic)
